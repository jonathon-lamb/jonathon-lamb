-  Hi, I’m @jonathon-lamb and I'm a recent graduate from a Physics program. I'm using this github to store and showcase some of my projects in Data Science and Machine Learning.
- I’m interested in all things Physics and Data Science. I mostly write code in Python and SQL but know some Js and have programmed different micro-electronics in C++.
- I’m proficient in Pandas, Numpy, Sklearn, Seaborn, and XGBoost and am currently learning Plotly, Dash, and Tensorflow.
